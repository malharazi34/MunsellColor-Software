# MunsellColor-Software
This project was a 5 week software project using SCRUM practices with 3 other team members in my Software Engineering course. 
The Software converts standard RGB colors into the Munsell Color system using Java. 
Some features include the display of different munsell colors, a munsell color test, finding a color's harmonious colors, etc.
